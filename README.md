Group Project - General Description

Working in groups of 3-4 students, you will design, develop, and implement a hypothetical e-commerce site utilizing the web technologies covered in class (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).

Specifications for general content and technologies used in the web site will be provided.

The web site should be an original idea but can be based on existing e-commerce sites. The idea can be hypothetical or a “real” web site for an actual client.

The web site will at minimum have a home page, product page(s), a login page/feature, user account and product management pages, a shopping cart, and a checkout page.

The web site will require full stack development, front-end through back-end.
